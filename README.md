# Future Work

Future enhancements include implementing advanced pathfinding algorithms (A* or Dijkstra) for intelligent patron navigation, adding weather impact on ride operations where rain slows rides and snow closes outdoor attractions. Collision detection using spatial partitioning would prevent patron overlap. Expanding the ride portfolio with 4-6 new attractions (Haunted House, Water Slide, Drop Tower) and developing patron AI with preferences for thrill tolerance, queue patience, and fatigue levels would increase realism. Long-term goals involve 3D visualization using Unity or Three.js, implementing park economics tracking revenue and expenses, and adding time-of-day simulation with dynamic lighting. Advanced features could include machine learning for queue prediction, mobile application integration, VR experiences, and multiplayer functionality for collaborative park management.
